          The Chronoshift website is the first website I ever made that required the use of programming skills. It involved the use of Figma, Photoshop, Google Docs to check for grammar errors, Html, and CSS. The goal was to make a website regarding time travel, where people could schedule a trip to any place they want to visit back in time.  I made this website with the tools I mentioned before. The concepts I gathered from making this website were many. I learned how Figma works and the different measurements it provides you with. If you want to design a website Figma will provide you with a white background optimized for computers. There you will be able to design and get an idea about how your website might look and also work as a guide. Another concept I learned is what the tools from Photoshop do in order to create original designs for my website. I encountered many problems when programming the website.

            The knowledge that I had received before starting this project was very basic. I didn't want my page to look like a house with no frills. I started my research on how to add details with CSS. It took me a long time to finish this project. I even delivered it a few days late. From my point of view, my project was the best in the class despite losing some points for being late. I had a hard time adding the images and buttons with special effects of the characters that were involved in this project. Despite everything I faced, I am pleased with how my project turned out, and I would call it success since this was my first website I ever made that required programming skills. The CART Habits of Mind “Investigate” and “Collaborate” showed me that without me going further in research on how to make the website look better and the help of my peers and instructors, I would not have completed this incredible project.
